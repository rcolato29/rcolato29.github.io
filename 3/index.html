                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This project implements image warping using homographies, which are maps between
                    a set of points in one image and a set of points in another. These homographies
                    are found using a system of linear equations, which are meant to relate
                    respective points in the two images together. We also build mosaics by fixing a
                    center of projection, capturing two overlapping angles of a views, computing a
                    warped image using a homography, projecting this warped image onto a base image,
                    and blending the two images together to create a composite panoramic image. In
                    the latter portion of the project, we transition to creating these mosaics
                    automatically by implementing and improving upon known corner detecting and
                    matching algorithms. We go into significant detail on the image warping and
                    mosaicing processes (both manual and automatic) in the sections to follow,
                    supplemented with ample image examples.

                <p>
                    The first thing to do is to gather the images that we will need to compute
                    homographies on and stitch together. These images need to be captured in a very
                    specific way: the center of projection (COP) needs to be fixed. The overlap
                    between the images must also be between 40%-70% for the best results. With this
                    in mind, we have compiled a few pairs of images that are suitable for our future
                    tasks.

                <p>
                    In order to warp images, a transformation must be constructed. In particular,
                    the transformation is a homography, or a 3x3 matrix that maps one pair of points
                    into another pair of points. This matrix has 8 degrees of freedom, and is of the
                    form p' = Hp. The systems of equations for a single pair of points (x, y) ->
                    (x', y') is as follows: xa + yb + c - xx'g - yx'h = x' and xd + ye + f - xy'g -
                    yy'h = y'. This creates 2 equations for 8 unknowns, and in order for the system
                    to be solvable, we need at least 8 equations for 8 unknowns (but preferrably
                    more). Therefore, in order to produce a homography, we need to specify at least
                    4 correspondences, after which we will be able to solve the system of linear
                    equations Ah = b (where h is the 8x1 vector of unknowns) using least squares
                    (find the h that satisfies min||Ah - b||^2). Below are the point correspondences
                    for pairs of images, as well as the computed homographies.

                <h2>Warp the Images</h2>
                <p>
                    Given the homography for a given pair of images, be able to actually carry out
                    an image warp. In order to prevent the presence of holes (where no pixels land)
                    after our transformation, we apply inverse warping (send pixels to their source
                    locations via the homographic map). Given this, we can interpolate the resulting
                    continuous-valued pixels in two ways: nearest neighbor interpolation and
                    bilinear interpolation. For nearest neighbor interpolation, we simply round
                    coordinates (which may land in between pixel values after the transformation) to
                    the nearest pixel value. For bilinear interpolation, we find the value of a
                    pixel by finding the weighted average of four neighboring pixels (in our case,
                    we take the four surrounding pixels that create a square). The resulting images
                    for both methods are shown below. Notice how marginal the differences are
                    between the two methods. However, nearest neighbor interpolation was noticably
                    faster to compute. Given the fact that the benefits of bilinear interpolation
                    are barely noticable, we opt for using NN interpolation for the remainder of
                    this project. Below are examples of rectification on difference images, where a
                    rectangular figure was captured at an angle, and then recovered using an images
                    warp via a homography.

                <h2>Blend the Images into a Mosaic</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to build our mosaics, we need to first compute a homography between a
                    given reference image and the image we wish to warp towards that reference
                    image. Once we know what this transformation is, we can construct the boundary
                    of the warped image by finding the coordinates where the homography sends its
                    corners (this is done to ensure that the warped image fits on the canvas). Then,
                    we warp via the inverse homography, where we check where each pixel in the
                    output canvas came from. Any pixels from within the image bounds gets assigned a
                    value using nearest neighbor interpolation. In addition, a binary mask is
                    creates which denote the pixels that contain the actual warped image. Once this
                    is done, we want to create a smooth blend between the two images. We soften the
                    binary mask computed for the warped image using a distance transform (pixels
                    near the edges are blurrier). The composite image is then created by computing a
                    weighted average for each pixel, where we sum up the intensity values by their
                    respective alpha values, keeping track of the sum of weights. We then normalize
                    each pixel by dividing the summed intensities by the summed weights. This allows
                    for appropriate pixel intensities in the region where the two images overlap.
                    The end result is a panorama-like blend of two images; multiple instance of such
                    on various buildings around the UC Berkeley campus can be found below.

                <h2>Harris Corner Detection</h2>
                <p>
                    Now we transition to a new effort to stitch images automatically. The rest of
                    this webpage roughly follows the paper "Multi-Image Matching using Multi-Scale
                    Oriented Patches" by Brown et al. The first step in this endeavor is to try to
                    detect corners automatically, so that we know which points to include for our
                    homography. The Harris Corner Detector is a solid first approach. This algorithm
                    computes the corner strength at a particular window by analyzing local
                    gradients, specifically in the x and y direction. These gradients are used to
                    construct the second moment matrix, where if the top left and bottom right
                    entries are large with the other two being zero, then a window is said to
                    contain a corner. This makes intuitive sense, since a corner is characterized by
                    dramatic changes in the gradient in both directions. One can also examine the
                    eigenvalues of the matrix in order to detect corners. I used the provided
                    get_harris_corners function, which calls the corner_harris and peak_local_max
                    functions imported from skimage. I set my window size to be 3 pixels, and my
                    min_distance parameter in peak_local_max to be 10 pixels, in order to make the
                    corners less densely packed. Finally, I discarded all corners within 20 pixels
                    from the image border in order to avoid noisy detections. The resulting Harris
                    corners on an image of the Valley Life Sciences Building can be seen below.

                    Notice how there are way too many detected corners, especially in parts of the
                    image that are very detailed. I could increase the threshold to classify the
                    image as a corner by manually putting more stringent requirements on the
                    eigenvalues, but I choose to opt for a more sophisticated approach via Adaptive
                    Non-Maximal Suppression, or ANMS. The process works as follows: for each
                    computed Harris corner x_i, find the minimum distance to another Harris corner
                    x_j such that the strength of x_i is strictly less than 0.9 * the strength of
                    x_j. The value 0.9, called the robustness factor, is chosen to make sure that
                    the current Harris corner has a large enough radius before encountering another
                    noticably stronger corner. Once all suppression radii are chosen, we take the
                    points corresponding to the 500 largest radii and use them as the new corners.
                    This ensures an even spread of corners while also taking into account their
                    strength. The much improved result given by ANMS can be seen on the same image
                    below.

                <h2>Feature Descriptor Extraction</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that we have 500 points of interest on an image via ANMS, we need to be able
                    to construct a sufficient local description for each corner that will aid with
                    point matching. We do this by extracting feature descriptors for each corner.
                    The process goes like this: take a 40x40 window around a corner and downsample
                    to an 8x8 patch. This downsampled patch is meant to discard the fine details of
                    the large window in order to capture the overarching structure around the point.
                    Once this is done, normalize the patch in order to provide robustness against
                    changes in lighting and contrast, which is achieved by subtracting by the mean
                    of the patch and dividing by the standard deviation. We construct these feature
                    descriptors for 10 random corners in an image, which can be seen on 3 seperate
                    images down below.

                <p>
                    Given 500 feature descriptors for each image, we will now attempt to associate
                    points between two images by matching their corresponding feature descriptors. A
                    first attempt to do this could involve naively matching feature descriptors
                    based on the L2 distance, but we find that this creates many false positives
                    where features are repetitive. Thus, we turn to Lowe's Ratio Test, which works
                    as follows: For each feature descriptor in the first image, find the two nearest
                    neighbors in the second image based on Euclidean distance, call them e_1 and
                    e_2. Then, deem two pairs of features descriptors to correspond to the same
                    point on two separate images if e_1 / e_2 is strictly less than a threshold. The
                    reason this is done is to ensure that the nearest neighbor is a clear better
                    match than the second nearest neighbor, otherwise the uncertainty could hint at
                    a mismatch. This procedure is meant to weed out all false positives that would
                    otherwise exist from naive matching. For the threshold, we decided on 0.4, which
                    is strict enough to filter out a lot of the obvious mismatches and narrow the
                    number of point pairs down to less than 15. There are still a few mismatches
                    present, which will certainly mess up the homography, but this will be fixed in
                    the next part. For now, here are the point matches for 3 pairs of images.

                <h2>RANSAC for Robust Homography</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to find the correct point correspondences needed to produce a useful
                    homography for warping, we adopt the 4-point RANSAC algorithm, which is meant to
                    cleanly filter out all point mismatches. Here is an outline of this algorithm:
                    First, randomly sample 4 pairs of features without replacement. Then compute the
                    homography, H, on these pairs and find where H takes points in the first image.
                    If the transformed point lands within epsilon of its corresponding point in the
                    second image, then include this pair in a set of "inliers". Repeat this process
                    for 1,000 iterations (sufficiently many to compute a stable homography), where
                    each iterations tries to expand the set of inliers and recompute an improved
                    homography. After the 1,000 iterations, take the best homography and compute the
                    best tranformed points, which will be used to create the mosaic (using the same
                    procedure as before). We found that an epsilon of 5 pixels works the best to
                    allow leeway for some noise, but conservative enough to prevent genuinely
                    different points from being associated together. Below, you can find
                    side-by-side comparisons between the manual image stitching used previously and
                    the newly automatic image stitching produced by RANSAC. One can see that there
                    are noticable improvements, such as cleaner blends between the images. The main
                    utility, however, is removing the need to manually specify corresponding points
                    between the two images, since we can now produce a mosaic automatically!
